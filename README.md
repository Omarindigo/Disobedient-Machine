"Disobedient Machine" is an innovative web-based interactive 3D experience that explores themes of autonomous artificial creations within a cyberpunk-inspired digital realm. Drawing inspiration from William Gibson's "Neuromancer," Scott Bukatman's "Disobedient Machines: Animation and Autonomy," and Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea," this project creates a unique digital storytelling platform.

Leveraging advanced web technologies, particularly Three.js, the project constructs a complex 3D environment featuring interactive spheres with varied properties, including video textures for dynamic content playback and custom materials with normal and displacement maps for enhanced realism. The scene is further enriched by elements such as frames and pipes, rendered with image textures and normal maps, contributing to its depth and complexity. Advanced lighting techniques, including a configurable spotlight and ambient lighting, are implemented alongside a custom shader that generates a dynamic, animated background. User interaction, a central focus of the experience, is facilitated through precise object interaction, triggering animations, video transitions, and audio playback. A JSON-based system manages dialogue presented through draggable popup elements, enhancing the interactive narrative. Additional features include video playlist functionality, multiple audio elements, and responsive design. By seamlessly integrating Three.js, HTML5 multimedia, the Fetch API, custom WebGL shaders, and modern JavaScript.

"Disobedient Machine" demonstrates the capabilities of browser-based 3D graphics and interactive storytelling. This technically advanced and visually compelling web experience provides users with an immersive platform to explore concepts of autonomy, artificial life, and human-machine interaction within a rich, cyberpunk-inspired digital environment.
